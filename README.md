## 🏗️ Software Architecture: Designing for Change

## 🏗️ Semantic-Based Service Orchestration Architecture (C4 Model Style)

This system enables smart service orchestration in an industrial setting using semantic technologies and context-aware mechanisms.

## System Context

- **Industrial Plant**: Provides field devices capable of offering services.
- **Smart Product**: Contains abstract process descriptions.
- **Context Broker**: Supplies environmental/contextual information.

---

## 📦 Containers

### 1. Smart Product
- **Purpose**: Provides high-level abstract process descriptions.
- **Output**: Triggers the orchestration process.
- **Sends To**: Process Decomposition.

### 2. Service Middleware
Encapsulates:
- Service Registration
- Service Discovery and Selection
- Service Orchestration

---

## 🧩 Components (within Middleware)

### 🧷 Service Registration
- **Field Device with μC** registers its service using OWL-S/WSDL.
- **Service Monitor (a)**: Monitors device state/services.
- **Repository Manager (b)**: Registers services into the Semantic Repository.
- **Semantic Service Repository (c)**: Stores semantically described services.

**Flow:**
- a: Device → Service Monitor
- b: Service Monitor → Repository Manager
- c: Repository Manager → Semantic Repository

---

### 🔎 Service Discovery and Selection
**Managed by Discovery Manager**

- **Matchmaker (Core)**:
  - Queries repository.
  - Matches services to abstract processes.
- **Ontology Manager (5)**:
  - Maintains ontology structure for semantic alignment.
- **Context-based Rating (6)**:
  - Rates matches based on context (received from Context Broker (7)).

---

### 🔄 Service Orchestration

1. **Process Decomposition**:
   - Breaks down abstract process from Smart Product.
2. **Process Orchestration**:
   - Aligns decomposed processes to discovered services.
3. **Process Invocation (9)**:
   - Executes the matched physical service in the plant.

---

## “Good architecture enables change with minimal pain.”

Software architecture defines the high-level structure of a system, focusing on:

✅ **Modularity**  
✅ **Maintainability**  
✅ **Performance**  
✅ **Scalability**

### 🧰 My Architectural Practices:
- **SOLID principles** and **GoF Design Patterns**
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** – to structure the core domain logic
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** – isolating layers and components
- **Cloud-native patterns** – containers, microservices, CI/CD pipelines

> 📌 *Architecture is not about today—it’s about anticipating tomorrow’s changes.*

## 🔌 Middleware Architecture: The Integration Backbone

![Middleware Integration Block Diagram](assets/middleware-architecture-block-diagram.png)

Middleware glues together diverse systems, protocols, and data formats. It enables **communication**, **transformation**, and **governance** in a hybrid digital landscape.

### 💡 Core Middleware Patterns:
- 📨 **Message Brokers**: Kafka, Azure Event Grid, RabbitMQ
- 🛡️ **API Gateways**: Authentication, throttling, routing
- 🧱 **Queue-based Decoupling**: Ensures fault-tolerant, loosely coupled systems
- 🔍 **Cross-cutting concerns**: Logging, security, telemetry, data mapping

> 🔄 Middleware makes integration **resilient**, **secure**, and **maintainable**.

## ⚙️ Service Orchestration: Coordinating the Digital Workforce

![Service Orchestration Flow](assets/service-orchestration-flow.png)

Microservices need orchestration to function as a unified application. It brings **order**, **monitoring**, and **resilience** to service workflows.

### 🧭 My Orchestration Strategy:
- **Orchestration vs Choreography**: Use orchestration for centralized control
- **Workflow Engines**: Durable Functions, Logic Apps, Camunda
- **Resilience Patterns**: Retry, circuit breakers, timeout handling
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Responsive and scalable integrations

> 🛠️ *Orchestration provides observability and control across distributed systems.*

---

## 🧱 Data Abstraction: Hide Complexity, Expose Value

![Data Abstraction Layers](assets/data-abstraction-layers.png)

Data abstraction streamlines how services interact with data sources, ensuring **consistency**, **security**, and **version control**.

### 🧵 Abstraction Techniques I Use:
- **Repository & Unit of Work Patterns** – isolate data access logic
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** – decouple service and transport layers
- **API Layer Abstractions** – maintain versioned, stable contracts
- **GraphQL / OData** – enable flexible and efficient queries

> 🧩 *Clean abstractions reduce coupling and boost agility.*
